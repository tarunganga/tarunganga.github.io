  Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m a full-stack developer with over eight years of experience crafting robust, scalable, and high-performance solutions. But beyond the code, there's more to me.Living in sunny San Diego, I love hitting the beach for walks with my wife, hiking the local trails, and diving into gaming sessions. These things keep me grounded and pumped up, sparking my creativity in the tech world. I’m also a huge tech enthusiast, always on the lookout for the latest trends and advancements.
